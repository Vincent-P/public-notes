Basically a ripoff of Rust's `std::option`.

One thing to keep in mind when using `std::optional` is that it doesn't have the same semantics as pointers, this code is perfectly fine:

```cpp
auto garbage = std::nullopt;
auto even_more_garbage = *garbage;
```

It doesn't throw any exception and will silently fails.
The equivalent to Rust's `unwrap()` is `value()`.

```cpp
auto garbage = std::nullopt;
auto not_garbage = garbage.value(); // <-- Will throw a std::bad_optional_access exception!
```
